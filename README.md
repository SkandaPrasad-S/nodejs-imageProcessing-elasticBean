# Image Processing API

## Overview

This project demonstrates a Node.js-based image processing API deployed using AWS Elastic Beanstalk. The API provides a single endpoint that accepts an image URL, processes the image, and returns the processed image.

## Node.js Endpoint

The API exposes the following endpoint:

### `GET /filteredimage`

- **Description**: This endpoint processes an image given its URL and returns the filtered image.
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `image_url` (required): The URL of the image to be processed.
- **Example Request**:
  ```bash
  curl "http://new-dev3.eba-jyyz7kur.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/filteredimage?image_url=https://via.placeholder.com/300/09f/fff.png"
  ```
- **Response**: The filtered image based on the provided URL will be returned.

## Deployment

The application was deployed using the Elastic Beanstalk CLI. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the steps followed:

1. **Initialize Elastic Beanstalk Environment**:
   ```bash
   eb init
   ```
   This command sets up the Elastic Beanstalk application and environment.

2. **Deploy the Application**:
   ```bash
   eb deploy
   ```
   This command packages the application and deploys it to the Elastic Beanstalk environment.

## Accessing the Application

The deployed application can be accessed at the following DNS endpoint:

[http://new-dev3.eba-jyyz7kur.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/filteredimage?image_url=https://via.placeholder.com/300/09f/fff.png](http://new-dev3.eba-jyyz7kur.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/filteredimage?image_url=https://via.placeholder.com/300/09f/fff.png)

Replace the `image_url` parameter with the URL of any image you wish to process.
